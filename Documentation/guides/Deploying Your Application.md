# Deploying Your Application

## Introduction

With OpenXtalk, it is easy to deploy your application to anyone.

Using the standalone building capability in OpenXtalk you can create a native
application for each operating system you want to support. Users who do not have OpenXtalk
can run these applications like any other application they download and install.
Standalone applications can have their own identity as true applications, include
icons, document associations and more.

## Building a Standalone Application

When you have finished your OpenXtalk application and what to distribute it you can build
it into a standalone application. These applications do not require users to have OpenXtalk.
All of OpenXtalk's feature set is available for use in a standalone application, with the
exception that you cannot set scripts on objects.

The builder itself will let you build standalone applications for any platform it supports,
from any platform it supports with the exception that iOS standalones must be
built on Mac OS X. For example you can build a Windows standalone on a Mac OS X
machine. However, you may wish to check that your application looks and behaves correctly
on each platform you intend to support. Please note it is inherently harder to debug an
application that has been built as a standalone, so you should test your application as
thoroughly as possible before building it.

### Step by step

Deploying an app to standalone is straightforward:

1) Open your stack in the OpenXtalk IDE

2) Select **File → Standalone Application Settings...** from the menu bar

3) Select the settings for your app

4) Make sure that checkboxes for each platform you wish to build for are checked

5) Close the standalone settings window

6) Select **File → Save as Standalone Application...** from the menu bar

Your application will be packaged up and placed in the selected output folder.

## Standalone Applications Settings

The Standalone Applications Setting dialog allows you to create settings for your
standalone application. This dialog can be found in the File menu. The settings you enter
are applied to the current front most editable stack and are saved with the stack. This
means you only need to enter the settings once for each application you create. The same
settings will apply if you do another build in the future.

|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mode Selector**       | Choose between the different standalone application settings screens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Standalone Name**     | Set the name of your standalone application. This should be the name you want your finished application to have. Don’t include a file extension (.exe on Windows or .app on Mac OS X) as the standalone builder can create standalones for multiple platforms and will add the appropriate extension automatically. |
| **Inclusions Selector** | Choose the components you want to include in a standalone. You may either choose to search for required inclusions automatically, or manually select the components you want to include.                                                                                                                            |

**Search for Inclusions**

This is the default option. When selected, OpenXtalk will search your application stack file
(main stack and sub stacks) to attempt to determine what components your application uses.
It will then include those items.

**Select Inclusions for the Standalone Applications**

Select this option if you want to specify the components to include manually. You may wish
to use this option if your application dynamically loads components that cannot be searched
at this point automatically, or if you know exactly what components your application uses
and wish to speed up the standalone building process by skipping the automatic search step.

It is important that you choose to include all the components that your application uses
or it may fail. If you do not include your own custom error reporting or OpenXtalk’s
standalone error reporting dialog (discussed below) such failure may be silent – i.e. an
operation in your standalone will simply cease working without displaying anything to the
user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| &nbsp;| &nbsp;|
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Profiles Settings**                        | Choose between the Property Profile settings options. You only need to alter settings in this area if you have used Property Profiles (see the section on *Property Profiles* in Chapter 4, Builder a User Interface above)                        |
| **Remove all profiles**                      | Removes all profiles and builds the standalone using the currently active profile on each object. Select this option if you don't need to change profile in the standalone and want to save disk space by removing extraneous profile information. |
| **Set all objects to profile**               | Set all objects to a specific profile then remove the profile data from objects.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Include profiles and the profile library** | Include the profile library and allow switching between profiles in the standalone application. You can choose whether to include specific profiles or all profiles.                                                                               |


#### Including Additional Stacks

![](images/standalone-settings-stacks.png)

Figure 2 – Standalone Settings – Stacks Tab

| &nbsp;| &nbsp;|
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stack Files**                          | Use this section to add additional stack files to your application. Any stacks you add to this section will be added to the `stackFiles`property of the main stack of your standalone. This means that any scripts within your standalone application will be able to locate and reference these stacks by name. |
| **Advanced Options**                     | Use this section to control exactly how multiple stack files are managed in your standalone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Move substacks into individual files** | If you select this option, each of the sub stacks in the stack files you select will be moved into their own individual file, located in the data folder or within the application bundle of your standalone.                                                                                                   |
| **Rename stackfiles generically**        | Renames each sub stack file using a number on disk (instead of using the name of the sub stack). Select this option if you do not want the names you have selected for stacks to be visible to the end user in the filing system.                                                                               |
| **Create folder for stackfiles**         | Creates a folder and places the stack files into that folder, instead of storing them at the same level as the standalone executable. All references in the `stackFiles`property will refer to this folder using a relative path so the stacks can still be located by the standalone application.               |
| **Individual stack options**             | Select a stack file on the left then an individual stack from within the file to set options on that stack.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Set destroyStack to true**             | Set this option if you want the selected stack file to be removed from memory when it is closed. This option is useful if you are loading large stacks into memory and want them to be removed when they are closed.                                                                                            |
| **Encrypt with password**                | Secures the scripts within the selected stack file with a password. This provides a basic level of encryption that prevents someone from casually reading the scripts in the stack by opening the file in a binary file viewer.                                                                                 |

> **Note:** A stack file directly attached to a standalone application cannot have changes
saved to it. This stack is bound directly to the executable file that runs. The OS locks
an executable file while it is running. If you want to save changes in your standalone
application, split your stack up until multiple files. A common technique is to create a
"splash screen" stack that contains a welcome screen and then loads the stacks that make
up the rest of your application. These stacks are referenced as `stackFiles`on this pane
in the standalone settings screen. It is thus possible to automatically update these
component stacks, or to save changes to them. You may also want to consider creating
preference files in the appropriate location on your end user's system (see the
`specialFolderPath`function and query/setRegistry functions for more information).

> **Note:** Adding additional stacks to the stacks tab is not supported for iOS,
Android or HTML5 standalones. Additional stacks may be included via the Copy
Files tab.

| &nbsp;| &nbsp;|
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Non-stack files in the application** | List other files to be included in the standalone. Use this feature to include help documents, read me files and other resources that you want to include with your standalone each time you build.                                                                    |
| **Copy Referenced Files**              | Loops over all image and player objects in stacks and copies any files referenced in the `fileName`property of these objects into the standalone. Then automatically sets the `fileName`property to reference these files in the standalone using referenced file paths. |
| **Destination folder**                 | Create a subfolder within your standalone to copy the image and movie files to.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

#### Including Additional Resources

![](images/standalone-settings-inclusions.png)

Figure 4 – Standalone Settings – Inclusions

The list of resources available to select for inclusion in a standalone
application are a combination of currently installed OpenXtalk Builder
extensions, externals and database drivers (both built-in and those
found in user folders), and built-in resources and script libraries.

The following built-in resources are available by default:

| &nbsp;| &nbsp;|
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ask Dialog**       | This option is required if any of your scripts use the "ask" or "ask password" commands. The standalone builder will copy the stack "ask dialog" from the IDE into your standalone as a sub stack. The standalone builder makes a copy of your stack before adding resources to it as part of the build process, so your original stack is unaltered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Answer Dialog**    | This option is required if any of your scripts use the "answer" command. Note that this only applies to the dialog form of the command. The answer file / printer / color / effect / folder / page setup / printer and record forms of the command do *not* require this option. The standalone builder will copy the stack "answer dialog" into your standalone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Browser**   	   | This option is required if your application uses the embedded browser or any `revBrowser` command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Browser (CEF)**    | This option is required if your application uses the embedded CEF browser or any `revBrowser` command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Brushes**          | This option is required if your application uses any of OpenXtalk's brush cursors. It is not required if your application does not make use of the painting commands. It copies the stack "brushes" into your standalone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Cursors**          | This option is required if your application uses any of OpenXtalk's cursors. It is not required if your application only uses OS cursors. It copies the stack "cursors" into your standalone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Build for Mac OS X 32-bit**                                   | Build a standalone that includes a 32 bit slice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Build for Mac OS X 64-bit**                                   | Build a standalone that includes a 64 bit slice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Application Icon**                                            | Choose an application icon to represent the application in the Finder. The icon should be in icns format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Document Icon**                                               | Choose a document icon to represent your application's documents in the Finder. The icon should be in icns format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Icons for ask / answer dialogs**                              | Choose an icon to display whenever you use the ask or answer commands to display a dialog. On Mac OS X, the convention is that these dialogs should display your application icon. The icon should be stored in your stack as an image, or selected from OpenXtalk's built-in icons. If you have used a built-in icon, be sure to select the relevant inclusion on the General tab (if you are selecting inclusions manually). |
| **PLIST – enter information and have OpenXtalk write the PLIST** | Have OpenXtalk fill out the PLIST for your application automatically. The PLIST is a settings file stored in XML format stored as part of every Mac OS X application. It contains information about the application, including its name, version number, copyright notice and document associations. Having OpenXtalk create this file for you is the recommended option. For more information about PLISTs consult [Apple's developer documentation](http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/plist.5.html)|
| **Choose a file to import into the application bundle**         | Choose to import a PLIST file instead of having OpenXtalk create one. Select this option if you have created your own highly customized PLIST that you want to use for your application in each build you create.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Short version / long version**                                | The version information to be included with your standalone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **Build for HTML5**             | Build a standalone for HTML5                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Almost every Internet-connected device has a web browser.  If your application
can run in a browser, your app can be used anywhere and by anyone, without any
need to download or install it.


##### Supported browsers

The following browsers are supported:

* [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/) 40.0 (or newer)
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) 44 (or newer)
* [Safari for Mac](https://support.apple.com/HT204416) 9.0 (or newer)

##### HTML5 engine features

The HTML5 engine in this release of OpenXtalk has a limited range of features.
You can:

* deploy single or multiple stack applications with embedded resources. Stacks
other than the main stack will open in their own floating container windows.
* use most of the engine's built-in controls and graphics capabilities.
* read and write temporary files in a special virtual filesystem (which is
erased when the user navigates away from the page)
* use OpenXtalk Builder widgets and extensions
* interact with JavaScript code in the web page using `do <script> as "JavaScript"`
* call JavaScript from OpenXtalk Builder widgets and extensions using the
com.OpenXtalk.emscripten module
* implement widgets by embedding DOM elements as native layers
* perform basic networking operations using the **load** command

Several important features are not yet supported:

* multimedia (the "player" control)

Two important unsupported features are unlikely to be added in the near future:

* operations that need to pause the script while something happens
  (e.g. `wait 10`)
* externals (including revdb)

##### Contents of the HTML5 standalone

The HTML5 standalone contains four files:

* A standalone archive, named `standalone.zip` by default.  This file contains
your application and all of the resources that it depends on.  When the engine
runs, the filesystem that's visible to the engine (e.g. via the `open file`
syntax) is based on the contents of the standalone archive.

* The engine itself, which consists of two files.  The `.js` file contains the
engine's executable code, and the `.html.mem` file contains essential data
that's needed for the engine to run.  These files are always the same, and only
change when OpenXtalk is upgraded.

* A test HTML page.  This can be opened in a browser and will correctly prepare,
download and start your HTML5 app in a convenient test environment.

##### Advanced: HTML5 standalone filesystem

JavaScript applications running in a browser don't have access to the host
system's filesystem.  Instead, the filesystem-related features of OpenXtalk, such
as `open file`, use a virtual filesystem (VFS) that exists only in memory.  This
filesystem is initialised before the engine starts, and is reset and its content
discarded when the engine stops (when the user closes the browser view or
navigates to a different page).

During engine startup, the VFS is populated from the contents of the
`standalone.zip` file that's created by the HTML5 deployment process.  All of
the initial files are stored in `/boot/` in the VFS.

There are several special files & directories in the `/boot/` directory:

* `/boot/__startup.data`: the standalone data including the mainstack,
extensions and auxiliary stackfiles and startup script.
* `/boot/fonts/basefont.ttf`: the font used by the engine
* `/boot/standalone/`: the `defaultFolder` when the engine starts, and the
location where additional assets selected using the "Copy files" page of the
standalone builder are placed

In general, if you wish to add new files or directories to the `standalone.zip`
archive, it is best to add them outside the `/boot/` directory tree.

##### Advanced: Embedding an HTML5 standalone in a web page

The default HTML5 page provided by the HTML5 standalone builder is designed for
testing and debugging purposes.  However, you may want to embed the standalone
engine in a more visually appealing page.  To do this, you require three
elements: 1) a canvas, 2) a JavaScript `Module` object, and 3) an HTML
`<script>` element that downloads the engine.

##### The canvas

The engine renders into a HTML5 `<canvas>` element contained within a `<div>`
element. There are some important considerations when creating the canvas &
div:

* both the canvas and div must have absolutely no border, or mouse coordinate
calculations will be incorrect

* they will be automatically resized by the engine to match the size of your
stack, so don't attempt to set their size using HTML or CSS

* the canvas should be the only element within the containing div, which may be
used to hold additional elements as native layers are added to the app.

* the canvas needs to be easily uniquely identifiable, so that the engine can
find it.

The absolute minimum canvas element would look something like this:

    <div><canvas style="border: 0px none;" id="canvas" oncontextmenu="event.preventDefault();"></canvas></div>

By default, most web browsers will indicate when the canvas has focus by
displaying a highlighted outline.  This helps users identify which part of
the web page is capturing their key presses.  You can usually disable this
outline by adding `outline: none;` to the canvas's CSS styles.

##### The Module object

The top-level JavaScript `Module` object contains the parameters that control
how the engine runs.  At minimum, you need only specify the `Module.canvas`,
which should be your canvas element.

The absolute minimum `Module` object declaration would look something like:

    <script type="text/javascript">
    var Module = {
      canvas: document.getElementById('canvas'),
    };
    </script>

##### Engine download

The engine is quite a large JavaScript file, so it's downloaded asynchronously
in order to let the rest of the page finish loading and start being displayed.

Quite straightforwardly:

    <script async type="text/javascript" src="standalone-<version>.js"></script>

Make sure to replace `<version>` as appropriate.

##### Bringing it all together

Here's the complete skeleton web page for an HTML5 standalone:

    <html>
       <body>
          <div>
             <canvas style="border: 0px none;" id="canvas" oncontextmenu="event.preventDefault()"></canvas>
          </div>

         <script type="text/javascript">
           var Module = { canvas: document.getElementById('canvas')  };
         </script>
        <script async type="text/javascript" src="standalone-community.js"></script>
      </body>
    </html>

##### Advanced: Speeding up engine download

Currently, the engine files are almost 30 MB, which is a lot to download before
the engine can start.  It is possible to speed up the download by enabling
deflate compression in the web server configuration.

Enabling deflate compression reduces the total download size to around 6.3 MB.
It's recommended to pre-compress the engine with `gzip`, and then configure your
web server to serve the pre-compressed files.

* For the Apache web server, configure `mod_deflate` to serve [pre-compressed content](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_deflate.html#precompressed)
* For the NGINX web server, add [`gzip_static on;`](https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/compression-and-decompression/#send)
to your configuration.

##### Advanced: Customizing the Module object

There are a number of OpenXtalk-specific `Module` attributes that you can modify
to affect how the engine behaves:

* `Module.OpenXtalkStandalone`: the filename of the standalone archive (default
`standalone.zip`)
* `Module.OpenXtalkStandalonePrefixURL`: Prepended to the standalone archive
filename to construct its full URL (default empty)
* `Module.OpenXtalkStandaloneRequest`: If you assign a network request to this
attribute (before the engine runs), then it will use that request for the
standalone archive instead of automatically starting a download for you. This
means that you can, in your HTML, fire off a request for the standalone before
the engine script actually arrives.  For this to work, the network request
should be an `XMLHttpRequest` with its `responseType` set to `arraybuffer`.

## Testing Your Application

Testing an app is straightforward:

1) Open your stack in the OpenXtalk IDE

2) Select **File → Standalone Application Settings...** from the menu bar

3) Select the settings for your app

4) Make sure that checkboxes for each platform you wish to build for are checked
as the chosen platforms will govern which test targets are available.

5) Close the standalone settings window

6) Choose **Development → Test Target → _Your Target_** from the menu bar to
select the target to test deployment to

7) Click the **Test** button or choose **Development → Test** from the menu bar

8) The standalone will be built and deployed to the target and launched. In
OpenXtalk Business Edition the remote debugger will detect any execution errors
and present them.

> **Note:** iOS devices connected via USB are detected as test targets in
OpenXtalk Business Edition and apps will be installed on them, however, they will
not be automatically launched.
